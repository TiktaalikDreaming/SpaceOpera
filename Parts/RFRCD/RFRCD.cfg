	description = A low powered electric device that produces thirst without propellant, colloqually known as an EM Drive, more properly known as a Radio-Frequency Resonant Cavity Device.  This produces less thrust than an ION thruster, but is more efficiant on propellant (doesn't use any).  It's got better thrust to power than a photon rocket.  Highly experimental
